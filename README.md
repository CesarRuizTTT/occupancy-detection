OCCUPANCY DETECTION:  MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS PERFORMANCE COMPARISON 
This study is an applied machine learning study with the aim of identifying the occupation of a room, based on parameters as temperature, humidity and CO2 level. It is based on the paper from O. TURKSOY, “HVAC Occupancy Detection with ML and DL Methods”, as an implementation of its code, modifiying, extending and adapting it to this study.

As the code is included in my document, showing explanations of every step, I find it useful as a guide to generate an ML project. I would appreciate your comments.
